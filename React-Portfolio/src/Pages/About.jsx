        <p>Hello! I’m a passionate and curious developer currently on the journey to becoming a Full-Stack Web Developer. I’m learning to build modern, responsive web applications using technologies like React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
          I enjoy solving problems, building projects that help people, and continuously improving my skills one line of code at a time. I’m excited to grow as a developer and collaborate on real-world projects that make a difference.</p>
